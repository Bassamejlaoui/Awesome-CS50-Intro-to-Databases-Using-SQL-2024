| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| week 0 | [Cyberchase](https://github.com/mejbass/CS50-Intro-to-Databases-Using-SQL/tree/master/Week%200/Cyberchase) |This problem set involves querying a database named cyberchase.db, with a table named episodes, to extract information related to the Cyberchase animated series. The queries range from listing episode titles to counting the number of episodes within specific time frames and exploring specific conditions using SQL commands. The distribution code provides necessary files, and the correctness of queries can be verified using provided test instructions or check50.
| week 0 | [36 Views](https://github.com/mejbass/CS50-Intro-to-Databases-Using-SQL/tree/master/Week%200/36%20Views) |This problem set involves querying a database called views.db, containing information on 72 woodblock prints by Hokusai and Hiroshige, to answer questions about the prints' titles, average colors, counts, and statistical measures, using SQL queries provided in .sql files. Correctness can be verified through manual testing or check50, with specific expected results for each query.
| week 0 | [Normals](https://github.com/mejbass/CS50-Intro-to-Databases-Using-SQL/tree/master/Week%200/Normals) |This problem set involves querying a database named normals.db, containing Climate Normal data on ocean surface temperatures at various depths and coordinates. The queries, written in .sql files, aim to extract specific information, such as temperatures at certain coordinates, depths, and the highest and lowest temperatures. The distribution code includes necessary files, and correctness can be verified through manual testing or check50, with expected results provided for each query.
| week 0 | [Players](https://github.com/mejbass/CS50-Intro-to-Databases-Using-SQL/tree/master/Week%200/Players) |This problem set involves querying a database named players.db, containing information about MLB players who played from 1871 to 2023. The queries, written in .sql files, aim to extract specific information, such as hometowns, batting sides, debut dates, and player characteristics. The distribution code includes necessary files, and correctness can be verified through manual testing or check50, with expected results provided for each query.
