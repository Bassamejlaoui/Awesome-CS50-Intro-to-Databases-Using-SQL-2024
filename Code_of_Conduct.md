# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

A primary goal of our community is to be inclusive to all contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible.

- **Understand Differences:** We might not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners or disrespectful behavior. Seek to understand different opinions and perspectives.

- **Be Empathetic:** Strive to be understanding and patient. It's okay to make mistakes; learn from them.
